Hello! <img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nixin72/nixin72/master/wave.gif" height="25" width="25" > </h1> Iâ€™m `Kevin Adrian Pillay`, a techie originally from South Africa now making waves in The Netherlands. By day, I'm a seasoned IT Systems Administrator, Developer, GameDev aficionado, and Cybersecurity enthusiast. 

When I'm not crafting marvels on the internet, you might catch me conjuring up creations offline. 
My fervor for all things tech is matched only by my insatiable appetite for technology. Every day is a chance to dive deeper into the vast sea of IT. 

  Â· ðŸŽ’ I try to code different projects to improve my technical and security skills, including game and app development.
