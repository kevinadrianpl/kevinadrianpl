Hello! <img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width = 15px> </h1> I’m `Kevin Adrian Pillay` from South Africa and I make things on the internet and occasionally off of it. I’m an experienced System Administrator and Cybersecurity professional/researcher and I have a passion for all things security, learning more each day. 

    🎒 I create different projects for fun on the side, mostly to learn about different technical aspects.
    ✈️ I travel a lot, and try to visit new places every time I do.
    🏋🏽‍♂️ When I'm not in front of a screen, I'm at the gym or finding a dog to pet.
