Hello! <img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nixin72/nixin72/master/wave.gif" height="25" width="25" > </h1> Iâ€™m `Kevin Adrian Pillay`, a techie originally from South Africa now making waves in The Netherlands. 

By day, I'm a seasoned IT systems administrator and cybersecurity enthusiast with a history of working in multiple industries over a period of 15 years. I've held various roles in IT management, server management, system administration, information security and in my spare time I develop things. 

My fervour for all things security is matched only by my insatiable appetite for technology. Every day is a chance to dive deeper into the vast sea of IT. 

  Â· ðŸŽ’ I try to code different projects to improve my technical and security skills, including game and app development.
  
  Â· ðŸ‘¾ From childhood gaming to developing games on the side, I've turned a youthful pastime into a passionate side project.
