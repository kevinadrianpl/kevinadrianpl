Hello! <img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width = 15px> </h1> I’m `Kevin Adrian Pillay` from South Africa and I make things on the internet and occasionally off of it. I’m an experienced System Administrator with a passion for all things information security, learning more each day. 

   - 🎒 I code different projects to learn about different technical and security skills.
   - ✈️ I travel, visiting new places every time I do.
